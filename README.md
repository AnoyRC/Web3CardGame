You will start the round with both receiving 1 card each, though opponents card will be hidden.

After that, the round begins with 2 choices in your hand. HIT or STAND. HIT refers, you want to receive a card, STAND, you don't want any card this round.

The round ends when both decides to stand. The winner is decided who has all the card sum up to or closest to 21. Note: If you crossed 21, even though you are closest to 21, the one who has less than 21 will be considered as winner.
